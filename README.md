# Generic DSP
A small generic Ada package with a handful of DSP functions.  I wrote this package since I needed to do some filtering inside a program of mine.  I thought that it could be useful to "extract" the code and make a project of its own in order to improve reusability.

Currently it only has code for complex FIR and IIR filters (why complex and not real?  Since in my program I needed complex filters).
